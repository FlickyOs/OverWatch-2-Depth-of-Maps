### Usage
 - Navigate to **"C:\Users\%usernames%\Documents\Overwatch\Settings"** and copy paste **"Settings_v0"** and name the new one **"gaming.ini"** (gaming.ini should be your gaming/competitive settings config).

 -Close the game and navigate to **"C:\Users\%usernames%\Documents\Overwatch\Settings"** and name the current **"Settings_v0"** to **"movie.ini"** (movie.ini should be your recording/high settings config).
